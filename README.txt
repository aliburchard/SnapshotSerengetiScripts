# SnapshotSerengetiScripts
Scripts for processing Snapshot Serengeti classification data

These scripts will take the raw data produced by the citizen science project Snapshot Serengeti 
(www.snapshotserengeti.org) and turn them into processed datasets that can then be used for analysis.

The raw data set and processed data sets can be found here doi:10.5061/dryad.5pt92
A description of all datasets, the field methods, and uses for the data can be found in
Swanson et al. 2015 . Scientific Data.
