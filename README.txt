SnapshotSerengetiScripts

Scripts for processing Snapshot Serengeti classification data

These scripts will take the raw data produced by the citizen science project 
Snapshot Serengeti (www.snapshotserengeti.org) and turn them into processed 
datasets that can then be used for analysis.

The raw dataset and processed datasets can be found here:

A description of all datasets, the field methods, and uses for the data can be 
found in:

images of 40 mammal species in Serengeti National Park. Scientific Data.
